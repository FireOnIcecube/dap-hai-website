        The DAP-HAI Research Center is dedicated to developing advanced theoretical frameworks for
        Human–AI interaction. Our work focuses on

        <strong>Distributed Adaptive Paradigms (DAP)</strong>
        <br />
        —a conceptual and architectural approach emphasizing multi-layer adaptivity, decentralized
        cognitive alignment, and robust interaction structures between humans and artificial
        intelligence systems. DAP-HAI examines how interaction, cognition, and adaptation can be
        re-architected for future AI systems, with emphasis on: – Multi-layer human–AI cognitive
        integration – Adaptive interaction paradigms – Distributed interaction structures –
        Generalizable and future-oriented theoretical models Our mission is to establish new
        conceptual grounds for the next generation of Human–AI systems through rigorous,
        framework-driven research.

        <h3>📌 Mission</h3>
        <p>
          DAP-HAI Research Center develops formal frameworks, cognitive architectures, and
          structural models for advanced human–AI interaction and co-reasoning. Our work focuses on
          establishing reproducible, interpretable, and transferable mechanisms for collaborative
          intelligence.
