# ✨ DAP-HAI.org Website Github Repository | Distributed Adaptive Paradigms for Advanced Human–AI Interaction

**This repository contains the source code for the official DAP-HAI Research Center website: [dap-hai.org](https://dap-hai.org).**

DAP-HAI is an independent research initiative focused on the core challenges and opportunities in **human–AI collaborative reasoning**, **interaction architectures**, and the **formal analysis of large-model behavior**.

Our work centers on exploring how human cognition and powerful language models can be effectively aligned through structured experimental methods, reproducible analytical workflows, and the creation of usable, transparent models.

## 🔬 Research Themes

We organize our work around three interconnected themes:

### 1. Human–AI Interaction & Cognitive Interfaces

Focuses on the practical and cognitive aspects of collaboration.

- **Interaction protocols** for high-bandwidth co-reasoning.
- **Adaptive task flows** and structured decision models.
- **Error-pattern mapping** and conversational failure taxonomy.

### 2. Model Behavior & Failure Analysis

Dedicated to rigorously understanding the internal dynamics and limitations of large models.

- Controlled-prompting experiments and comparative behavior logging.
- Analysis of **breakdown modes**, stability issues, and reasoning drift under reproducible conditions.

### 3. Formal and Semi-Formal Modeling

Developing structural and analytical frameworks for complex interactions.

- Creating **task-flow schematics**, diagrams, and lightweight structural models.
- Representing decisions, actions, and event sequences to integrate insights from AI, cognition, and systems theory.

## 🛠️ Methods & Approach

Our methodology is grounded in rigorous, small-scale experimentation and structural analysis:

- Designing **small, reproducible experiments** with language models.
- Logging, comparing, and clustering model behavior signatures.
- Building **diagrams, taxonomies, and structural schemata** to map complex processes.
- Translating complex insights into **clear, usable models** for practitioners and researchers.
- Iterative refinement of human–AI collaboration templates.

## 🔭 Current Work Highlights

- Modeling how agents select and sequence actions in complex tasks.
- Identifying recurring model-behavior signatures across different prompts and models.
- Designing reusable **interaction frameworks** for general research workflows.
- Developing early-stage tools for structured reasoning processes.
